# Lambda Concurrency Improvements

## Overview
This update modifies the Lambda functions to handle increased concurrent executions with improved performance and reliability.

## Changes Made

### 1. SAM Template Updates (`template.yaml`)
- **Runtime Upgrade**: Updated from Python 3.8 to Python 3.9 for better performance
- **Reserved Concurrency**: Set to 100 concurrent executions per function
- **Memory Allocation**: Increased to 256MB for better performance
- **Timeout**: Set to 30 seconds to handle potential delays

### 2. Lambda Function Optimizations

#### Performance Improvements:
- **Global Variables**: Moved environment variable reads outside handler for reuse
- **Error Handling**: Added try-catch blocks for better error management
- **Input Validation**: Added safe dictionary access with `.get()` methods
- **Reduced Logging**: Minimized print statements to reduce execution time

#### Concurrency Considerations:
- **Stateless Design**: Ensured functions remain stateless for concurrent execution
- **Connection Reuse**: Prepared for connection pooling in future iterations
- **Memory Efficiency**: Optimized variable usage and cleanup

### 3. Benefits

#### Scalability:
- **100 Concurrent Executions**: Each function can handle up to 100 simultaneous requests
- **Faster Cold Starts**: Python 3.9 runtime provides improved cold start performance
- **Better Resource Utilization**: Increased memory allocation reduces execution time

#### Reliability:
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error responses prevent function crashes
- **Input Validation**: Safe handling of malformed requests
- **Consistent Response Format**: Standardized error and success responses

## Deployment

Deploy the updated stack using:
```bash
sam build
sam deploy --guided
```

## Monitoring

Monitor concurrency metrics using:
- CloudWatch Lambda Concurrent Executions metric
- Duration and Error Rate metrics
- Throttles metric to identify capacity limits

## Future Enhancements

Consider these additional improvements for even higher concurrency:
- Provisioned Concurrency for predictable workloads
- Connection pooling for external services
- Async processing patterns for non-critical operations
